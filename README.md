## Sending Data

### Event Methods
```cpp
//C# Event Method Signatures
public void Abxr.Event(string name);
public void Abxr.Event(string name, Dictionary<string, string> meta = null);
public void Abxr.Event(string name, Dictionary<string, string> meta = null, Vector3 location_data = null);

// Example Usage - Basic Event
Abxr.Event("button_pressed");

// Example Usage - Event with Metadata
Abxr.Event("item_collected", new Dictionary<string, string> {
    {"item_type", "coin"},
    {"item_value", "100"}
});

// Example Usage - Event with Metadata and Location
Abxr.Event("player_teleported", 
    new Dictionary<string, string> {{"destination", "spawn_point"}},
    new Vector3(1.5f, 0.0f, -3.2f)
);
```
**Parameters:**
- `name` (string): The name of the event. Use snake_case for better analytics processing.
- `meta` (Dictionary<string, string>): Optional. Additional key-value pairs describing the event.
- `location_data` (Vector3): Optional. The (x, y, z) coordinates of the event in 3D space.

Logs a named event with optional metadata and spatial context. Timestamps and origin (`user` or `system`) are automatically appended.

### Event Wrappers (for LMS Compatibility)
-The LMS Event Functions are specialized versions of the Event method, tailored for common scenarios in XR experiences. These functions help enforce consistency in event logging across different parts of the application and are crucial for powering integrations with Learning Management System (LMS) platforms. By using these standardized wrapper functions, developers ensure that key events like starting or completing levels, assessments, or interactions are recorded in a uniform format. This consistency not only simplifies data analysis but also facilitates seamless communication with external educational systems, enhancing the overall learning ecosystem.

#### Assessments
Assessments are intended to track the overall performance of a learner across multiple Objectives and Interactions. 
* Think of it as the learner's score for a specific course or curriculum.
* When the Assessment is complete, it will automatically record and close out the Assessment in the various LMS platforms we support.

```cpp
//C# List Definition
public enum ResultOptions
{
    Pass,
    Fail,
    Complete,
    Incomplete
}

//C# Event Method Signatures
public void Abxr.EventAssessmentStart(string assessmentName) 
public void Abxr.EventAssessmentStart(string assessmentName, Dictionary<string, string> meta = null)

public void Abxr.EventAssessmentComplete(string assessmentName, int score, ResultOptions result = ResultOptions.Complete)
public void Abxr.EventAssessmentComplete(string assessmentName, int score, ResultOptions result = ResultOptions.Complete, Dictionary<string, string> meta = null)

// Example Usage
Abxr.EventAssessmentStart("final_exam");
Abxr.EventAssessmentComplete("final_exam", 92, ResultOptions.Pass);
```

#### Objectives
```cpp

public void Abxr.EventInteractionComplete(string interactionName, string result, string result_details = null, InteractionType type = InteractionType.Text, Dictionary<string, string> meta = null)

// Example Usage
Abxr.EventInteractionStart("select_option_a");
Abxr.EventInteractionComplete("select_option_a", "true", "a", InteractionType.Select);
```

### Other Event Wrappers
#### Levels
```cpp
//C# Event Method Signatures
public void Abxr.EventLevelStart(string assessmentName) 

public void Abxr.EventLevelComplete(string levelName, int score)
public void Abxr.EventLevelComplete(string levelName, int score, Dictionary<string, string> meta = null)

// Example Usage
Abxr.EventLevelStart("level_1");
Abxr.EventLevelComplete("level_1", 85);
```

**Parameters for all Event Wrapper Functions:**
- `levelName/assessmentName/objectiveName/interactionName` (string): The identifier for the assessment, objective, interaction, or level.
- `score` (int): The numerical score achieved. While typically between 1-100, any integer is valid. In metadata, you can also set a minScore and maxScore to define the range of scores for this objective.
- `result` (ResultOptions for Assessment and Objective): The basic result of the assessment or objective.
- `result` (Interactions): The result for the interaction is based on the InteractionType.
- `result_details` (string): Optional. Additional details about the result. For interactions, this can be a single character or a string. For example: "a", "b", "c" or "correct", "incorrect".
- `type` (InteractionType): Optional. The type of interaction for this event.
- `meta` (Dictionary<string, string>): Optional. Additional key-value pairs describing the event.

**Note:** All complete events automatically calculate duration if a corresponding start event was logged.

### Telemetry
The Telemetry Methods provide comprehensive tracking of the XR environment. By default, they capture headset and controller movements, but can be extended to track any custom objects in the virtual space. These functions also allow collection of system-level data such as frame rates or device temperatures. This versatile tracking enables developers to gain deep insights into user interactions and application performance, facilitating optimization and enhancing the overall XR experience.

To log spatial or system telemetry:
```cpp
//C# Event Method Signatures
public void Abxr.Telemetry(string name, Dictionary<string, string> data)

// Example usage
Abxr.Telemetry("headset_position", new Dictionary<string, string> { {"x", "1.23"}, {"y", "4.56"}, {"z", "7.89"} });
```

**Parameters:**
- `name` (string): The type of telemetry data (e.g., "OS_Version", "Battery_Level", "RAM_Usage").
- `data` (Dictionary<string, string>): Key-value pairs of telemetry data.

---
### AI Integration Methods
The Integration Methods offer developers access to additional services, enabling customized experiences for enterprise users. Currently, this includes access to GPT services through the AIProxy method, allowing for advanced AI-powered interactions within the XR environment. More integration services are planned for future releases, further expanding the capabilities available to developers for creating tailored enterprise solutions.

#### AIProxy
```cpp
//C# Event Method Signatures
public string Abxr.AIProxy(string prompt, string past_messages = "", string bot_id = "")

// Example usage
Abxr.AIProxy("Provide me a randomized greeting that includes common small talk and ends by asking some form of how can I help");
```

**Parameters:**
- `prompt` (string): The input prompt for the AI.
- `past_messages` (string): Optional. Previous conversation history for context.
- `bot_id` (string): Optional. An identifier for a specific pre-defined chatbot.

**Returns:** The AI-generated response as a string.

**Note:** AIProxy calls are processed immediately and bypass the cache system. However, they still respect the SendRetriesOnFailure and SendRetryInterval settings.

### Authentication Methods

#### SetUserId
```cpp
//C# Event Method Signatures
public void Abxr.SetUserId(string userId)
```

#### SetUserMeta
```cpp
//C# Event Method Signatures
public void Abxr.SetUserMeta(string metaString)
```

**Parameters:**
- `userId` (string): The User ID used during authentication (setting this with trigger re-authentication).
- `metaString` (string): A string of key-value pairs in JSON format.

## Exit Polls
Deliver questionnaires to users to gather feedback.
```cpp
// C# List Definition
public enum PollType
{
    Thumbs,
    Rating,
    MultipleChoice
}

// C# Event Method Signature
public static void PollUser(string prompt, ExitPollHandler.PollType pollType, List<string> responses = null, Action<string> callback = null)

// Example usage
Abxr.PollUser("How would you rate this training experience?", PollType.Rating);
```
**Poll Types:**
- `Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down`
- `Rating (1-5)`
- `Multiple Choice (2-8 string options)`

## Headset Removal (Session Integrity)
To improve session fidelity and reduce user spoofing or unintended headset sharing, we will trigger a re-authentication prompt when the headset is taken off and then put back on mid-session. If the headset is put on by a new user this will trigger an event defined in Abxr.cs. This can be subscribed to if the developer would like to have logic corresponding to this event.
```cpp
public static Action onHeadsetPutOnNewSession;
```
If the developer would like to have logic to correspond to these events, that would be done by subscribing to these events.

## Debug Window
The Debug Window is a little bonus feature from the AbxrLib developers.
To help with general debugging, this feature routes a copy of all AbxrLib messages (Logs, Events, etc) to a window within the VR space. This enables developers to view logs in VR without having to repeatedly take on and off your headset while debugging.

### Setup
To use this feature, simply drag the `AbxrDebugWindow` Prefab from `AbxrLib for Unity/Resources/Prefabs`, to whatever object in the scene you want this window attached to (i.e. `Left Controller`).

## FAQ

### Q: How do I retrieve my Application ID and Authorization Secret?
A: Your Application ID can be found in the Web Dashboard under the application details. For the Authorization Secret, navigate to Settings > Organization Codes on the same dashboard.

### Q: How do I enable object tracking?
A: Object tracking can be enabled by adding the Track Object component to any GameObject in your scene via the Unity Inspector.
